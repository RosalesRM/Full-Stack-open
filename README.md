# Full Stack open

This repository documents my personal journey through the **Full Stack open** course. It contains structured exercises, diagrams, and notes organized by parts and subfolders.

The course covers the foundational and advanced principles of modern full stack web development, including:

- Basic web architecture and HTTP communication
- DOM manipulation and JavaScript fundamentals
- Single Page Applications (SPA)
- Modern front-end frameworks
- Server-side development with Node.js
- RESTful APIs and asynchronous operations
- Full stack application development practices

## Repository Structure

Each part of the course has its own folder, which may contain multiple subfolders related to specific exercises or projects.

- This repository is managed using `git`, and each section is pushed to GitHub for version control and tracking.
- Submissions follow a clear naming structure to ensure readability and review efficiency.
